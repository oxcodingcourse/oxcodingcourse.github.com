<h2 id='using_the_command_line'>Using the command line</h2>

<p>If you are using a mac, open Terminal.app. If you are on windows, as part of the package you downloaded from <a href='www.railsinstaller.org'>RailsInstaller</a> you should now have a program called <code>gitbash</code>. Open that!</p>

<p>These terminals are a way to interact with your computer programmatically. If you are doing any software development you will need to get to grips with using the terminal, as many of the programmes you will use will be run from the terminal, instead of by clicking an icon.</p>

<p>The first thing you will need to get used to is moving around. Start by printing the name of the directory you are in:</p>

<pre><code>$ pwd</code></pre>

<p>Then have a look at what&#8217;s in that directory ( <em>list</em> the contents):</p>

<pre><code>$ ls</code></pre>

<p>To move up a directory ( <em>change directory</em> ) do</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ..</code></pre>

<p>To move back do</p>

<pre><code>$ cd name_of_the_directory</code></pre>

<p>Your commandline will help you: <kbd>tab</kbd> can often be used to auto-complete names of files, the up arrow can be used to cycle through previous commands that you have typed.</p>

<p>You should navigate to your <code>coding_course</code> folder that you created last week, using <code>cd</code>. When you get there create a new directory (_make directory_) for your site:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir first_site</code></pre>

<p>Note: choosing names without spaces makes command line navigation easier.</p>

<h2 id='using_git'>Using git</h2>

<p>Git is a version control system. It allows you to keep the entire history of your code, and makes it easy to share and collaborate with others.</p>

<p>We will enable our new folder to work with git:</p>

<pre><code>$ git init</code></pre>

<p>To see what this has done do:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -a</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-a</code> is a flag which tells the <code>ls</code> command to show hidden files and folders. You should see a folder called <code>.git</code> in the results. Move into this folder, and have a look around:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd .git
$ ls</code></pre>

<p>All the data to allow git to version control your code will be stored inside this hidden folder. If you ever want to &#8216;un-version-control&#8217; your code all you have to do is delete this folder.</p>

<p>Apart from this hidden git folder, the first_site folder currently empty. We&#8217;ll add the html file you created last week:</p>

<pre><code>$ mv ../first_html_page.html .</code></pre>

<p><code>mv</code> is for move. The line above assumes that your homework is stored in the directory above - just like <code>cd ..</code> moves up a directory, <code>..</code> is used to specify the directory above in a file path. The <code>.</code> refers to the current directory and tells <code>mv</code> where to move the file to.</p>

<p>To see what git thinks about this do</p>

<pre><code>$ git status</code></pre>

<p>It should tell you that you have an &#8216;untracked file&#8217;.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll now add this file to the git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add .
$ git commit -m &quot;Imported first_html_page&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Adding to a git repo is a two stage process, but most of the time we will perform these two steps together. The <code>add .</code> tells git to add everything in the current folder (<code>.</code> = current folder, just like in <code>mv</code>) into the local index. The <code>git commit</code> adds everything in the local index into the repository.</p>

<p>You can see your commit by doing</p>

<pre><code>$ git log</code></pre>

<p>or you can get a nice diagram showing your repo by doing</p>

<pre><code>$ gitk --all</code></pre>

<h2 id='css'>CSS</h2>

<p>Last week we looked at HTML, and saw how this was used to mark up the information in a webpage. Right now, your HTML pages don&#8217;t look very good, as you haven&#8217;t given any styling information. The way to do this is using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).</p>

<p>There are a few ways to include CSS in an HTML file: the proper way is to link to a separate <code>.css</code> file in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. This allows web browsers to download the <code>.css</code> file once for the entire site, which speeds up loading times. You can also put the css inline, or write it directly into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. For simplicity we&#8217;ll do this:</p>

<p>Make your html header look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Some title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    h1 { color: red; }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The bit inside the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags is CSS. The <code>h1</code> bit specifies the tag that will be styled. The bit inside the <code>{ ... }</code> specifies the styles that will be applied. Here we change the colour of the <code>h1</code> text red.</p>

<p>If you save the changes to the html file, then open (or refresh) the page in your browser you should see the changes. By opening the developer tools, and hovering over the <code>h1</code> you should be able to see your css rule at the side.</p>

<p>Try out the following:</p>

<pre><code>p { color: blue; }
div { background-color: pink; }
div#lists { background-color: green; }</code></pre>

<p>The <code>div#lists</code> bit selects only the div with the lists id: <code>&lt;div id=&quot;lists&quot;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If anything, these changes will have made your site look a lot worse - but I hope you get the idea!</p>

<p>Now go back to the command line, commit these changes, and have a look at the repo:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add .
$ git commit -m &quot;Added some css&quot;
$ gitk --all</code></pre>

<h2 id='pushing_code_to_github'>Pushing code to github</h2>

<p>Github is a site which will host a git repo online for you, making it easy to collaborate with others. We&#8217;ll now put the first website online.</p>

<p>Go to github, login, and click &#8220;Create New Repo&#8221; in the top left hand corner. Follow the instructions, calling it something like <code>first_site</code>. You&#8217;ll get to a page when it&#8217;ll describe how to get your code online. You want to follow the instructions for &#8220;Pushing an existing repository to github&#8221;. It&#8217;s probably best to use the http option, instead of ssh. You should end up doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/first_site.git
$ git push -u origin master</code></pre>

<p>You should now be prompted to add your github username and password. If all goes well, when you go to github you should see the <code>first_site</code> folder containing your html file.</p>

<h2 id='for_next_time'>For next time</h2>

<h3 id='get_github_to_serve_your_page_as_a_website'>Get github to serve your page as a website</h3>

<p>Github will host an html site for free for you, through a service called <a href='http://pages.github.com/'>github pages</a>. There are two possibilities for telling github to make your code into a website:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call your repo <code>yourusername.github.com</code></li>

<li>Push your site to a branch called <code>gh-pages</code></li>
</ol>

<p>We&#8217;ll do the second, even though you don&#8217;t know what branches are. So for the moment, some of this won&#8217;t make much sense - hopefully it will at some point in the future!</p>

<p>To do the <code>gh-pages</code> approach first open the file <code>first_site/.git/config</code> in your code editor. This might be tricky, as it is a hidden folder and might not show up in the list when you do <code>File &gt; Open</code>. To find out how to do this google &#8220;windows show hidden files&#8221; or similar.</p>

<p>It should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[core]
  repositoryformatversion = 0
  filemode = true
  bare = false
  logallrefupdates = true
  ignorecase = true
  precomposeunicode = false
[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
  url = https://github.com/TomClose/first_site.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch &quot;master&quot;]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/master</code></pre>

<p>You want to change it so that it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[core]
  repositoryformatversion = 0
  filemode = true
  bare = false
  logallrefupdates = true
  ignorecase = true
  precomposeunicode = false
[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
  url = https://github.com/TomClose/first_site.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
  push = +refs/heads/master:refs/heads/gh-pages
  push = +refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master
[branch &quot;master&quot;]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/master</code></pre>

<p>and then save the file. Don&#8217;t worry about what this means right now.</p>

<p>If you then do</p>

<pre><code>$ git push</code></pre>

<p>it should say that it pushed both to origin/master and origin/gh-pages. After waiting a few minutes for github to get ready, you should be able to see your site at <code>yourusername.github.com/first_site</code>.</p>

<h3 id='get_your_domain_name_to_point_to_your_website'>Get your domain name to point to your website</h3>

<p>There are two things you need to do to get your domain name working with your github pages site</p>

<ol>
<li>Tell your domain registrar (e.g 123-reg or godaddy) to point towards github</li>

<li>Tell github that your site should be matched with that domain name when the request gets to github Github explains this <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages'>here</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The second bit is easy:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Open your code editor, and create a new file</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Write your domain name on the first line of the new file e.g: <code>
mydomain.com
</code></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Save that file as <code>CNAME</code> (with no extension) in your <code>first_site</code> folder</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Add and commit your changes locally, then push to github:</p>

<pre><code>   git add .
   git commit -m &quot;Added CNAME&quot;
   git push</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For the first bit you need to log in to your domain registrar and change the DNS settings. You want an <em>A-record</em> pointing to <code>204.232.175.78</code> (which is github.com). Note that it can take up to a couple of days for DNS changes to propagate.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using 123-reg, your should log in, select your domain from the list, and click &#8220;Manage&#8221;. You should then go to &#8220;Manage DNS&#8221;.</p>

<p><img alt='123-reg DNS Settings' src='./assets/dns_settings.png' /></p>

<p>(The @ dns entry stands for the root or bard domain.)</p>

<p>Your changes won&#8217;t take effect immediately. You can check by visiting your url (which should end you up at github), or by running</p>

<pre><code>$ host yourdomain.com</code></pre>

<p>at the command prompt (or <code>nslookup</code> on windows).</p>

<h3 id='note_on_seeing_your_page'>Note on seeing your page</h3>

<p>If your page is called <code>first_page.html</code> and your git repository is called <code>first_site</code>, to see it (as a github page) you need to go to <code>yourusername.github.com/first_site/first_page</code>. If you go to <code>yourusername.github.com/first_site</code> you will see a github error page.</p>

<p>This is also the case when you set up your domain name: you will need to go you <code>yourdomain.com/first_page</code> to see the page, and <code>yourdomain.com</code> will show a github error page.</p>

<p>If you want to change this behaviour, and see the page at <code>yourdomain.com</code>, all you need to do is change your page&#8217;s name to <code>index.html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cd first_site
mv first_page.html index.html
git add .
git add -u
git commit -m &quot;Renamed first page&quot;
git push</code></pre>

<p>This works because by convention pretty much all servers (github&#8217;s included) will serve the page called <code>index.html</code> if you don&#8217;t specify anything else. (The <code>git add -u</code> is the command you need to tell git that you&#8217;ve deleted or renamed somthing - otherwise it&#8217;ll add the new <code>index.html</code> but won&#8217;t notice that <code>first_page.html</code> isn&#8217;t there.)</p>

<h3 id='make_your_page_look_better'>Make your page look better</h3>

<p>Try experimenting with your css to make your page look a bit better. The following resources might be useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.htmldog.com/guides/cssbeginner/'>HTMLDog css tutorials</a> worth a skim to find out a bit more about css</li>

<li><a href='http://www.csszengarden.com/'>CSS ZenGarden</a> - all the different designs here use exactly the same html. A bit over-the-top but shows what can be done with css.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a mess around and see what you can do!</p>
